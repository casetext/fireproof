=========

Firebase runs hot! Don't burn yourself with callbacks. Use promises instead.
Fireproof wraps Firebase objects with lightweight promise support.

## Installation
```bash
npm install --save fireproof
```

## Usage

See the API documentation [here.](https://github.com/casetext/fireproof/blob/master/api.md)

The bottom line is this: all Firebase methods are reproduced on a Fireproof object.

You can choose to "bless" Fireproof with a promise library that follows the deferral model, or any spec-compliant promise constructor. Q.js, Kew, and Angular $q are some examples. Just call Fireproof.bless(Q). If you don't, Fireproof tries to use the native Promise constructor, if available.

- If the corresponding Firebase method has no return value but does something asynchronously, Fireproof returns a promise that fulfills if the interaction succeeds and rejects if an error occurs. This is true of, e.g., ```transaction()```, ```auth()```, ```set()```, ```update()```, ```remove()```, and ```once()```.

- For ```on()```, Firebase returns the callback method that you passed in. Fireproof returns your _wrapped_ callback method with an extra method, ```then()```, attached. So the callback is effectively a promise!

- For ```push()```, Firebase returns the reference to the new child. Fireproof does the same, but the reference is also a promise that resolves if the push
succeeds and rejects if the push fails.

- All Fireproof objects are themselves promises. Except for the case of
```push()``` mentioned above, their then() is a shortcut for
```fp.once('value')```. This means you can get the value of any Fireproof object
at any time just by treating it as a promise!

```javascript
var Fireproof = require('fireproof'),
  Firebase = require('firebase');

var fb = new Firebase('https://test.firebaseio.com/thing'),
  fp = new Fireproof(fb);

fireproof.auth('my_auth_token').then(function() {
  console.log('Successfully authenticated.')
}, function(err) {
  console.error('Error authenticating to Firebase!');
})
```
